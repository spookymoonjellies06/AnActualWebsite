# Hungry For Horrors
I watch widely popular horror movies and occasionally tv-shows, **cult-classics** even, and rate them on a skull-o-meter. Read all about the fun facts that came out of the making of these movies and some of my personal opinions on what makes these movies so awesome!!
# Work Those Ratings!!
Each of my ratings are going to be done based on how much I liked watching them, what I found cool about them, really anything that stood out to me. The ratings will be out of 10 skulls each, half points may be used, if they are they'll be represented by ghosts.

I really loved the use of practical effects by the costume and set designers. Especially when it came to Ginger's transformation and making her gradual change into a wolf noticeable. The effects in this movie were very reminiscent of 80's horror films and it made me really happy to see!! The wolves that were built really enhanced the feel of the movie, making it seem like they were realistic, even if you knew they weren't. I think the movie also really brought home the "teenagedom" of it all, making you feel like you were in high school with Ginger and Bridgitte; especially as they were seen as the school outcasts. With this in mind, it felt like Ginger's transformation wasn't just about becoming a werewolf, more that it was about losing herself to popularity and it becoming her downfall. I was super excited to finally see a werewolf movie, sorry vampire movies you're cool and all, but there are other monsters too. The little details that wre put ito everything definitely brought the characters to life, you got a better sense of Ginger and Bridgitte because of the clothes they wore and their room. You got to see how different they were not only from the town, but also their parents with the contrasts in lighting and decoration. Their dynamic felt like a real sibling dynamic, although there were some parts where it was a bit questionable, but overall the movie was pretty rad. I also loved the fact that the Fitzgerald sisters were played by the iconic duo Katherine Isabelle and Emily Perkins, they really took the weird sister roles in the early 2000's and I thank them for that.

This movie has recently become a cult classic and for great reason, it's jam-packed full of funny one liners like "I am a god" and "I eat boys", which even if it wasn't explicitly said the idea was there and it gets stuck in my head very fast. The soundtrack is absolutely amazing, which is expected for the time, since it was the height of the emo scene; it makes you feel like you're living in the early 2000's even if it's way past that. The not so obvious motif of reclamation, specifically after going through trauma that was inflicted due to sexual violence is so prominent within the movie and even though it may not have been the best representation that people needed, it definitely feels real. The intense need for revenge, going after those who wronged you and used you for their entertainment was strong within Jennifer's arc and later bled into Needy's. The outfits really felt like something high schooler's would wear, so they definitely deserve some points for that. I really appreciated the scene where Jennifer tries to put makeup on after her "demonic" transformation; a symbol for peforming femininity, but also as a way of trying to get back her former self after a traumatizing event.

It definitely has some iconic lines that are constantly quoted like "Do you like scary movies?" and "Please don't kill me Mr. Ghostface, I wanna be in the sequel.", it's definitely one of those gateway slasher films. Once you watch it you sort of want to start watching other slasher movies and maybe you'll navigate through different horror genres until you find one that you really like. In terms of "final girls" Sidney is one of the most popular ones that is known in the wider rings of society. It's been five movies and she's still surviving Ghostface. It's definitey a fun little slasher to watch, it also mackes a mockery of slashers whilst being a slasher itself.
