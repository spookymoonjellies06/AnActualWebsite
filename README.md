# Hungry For Horrors
I watch widely popular horror movies and occasionally tv-shows, _cult-classics_ even, and rate them on a skull-o-meter. Read all about the fun facts that came out of the making of these movies and some of my personal opinions on what makes these movies so awesome!!
# Work Those Ratings!!
Each of my ratings are going to be done based on how much I liked watching them, what I found cool about them, really anything that stood out to me. The ratings will be out of 10 skulls each, half points may be used, if they are they'll be represented by ghosts.

Fun Facts: All the effects in the movie are practical effects, even the wolves themselves. The wolves are actually stunt men in wolf suits, they had to take multiple breaks while filming to rest and so that they wouldn't overheat. This isn't really about the movie, just a little tid-bit I love and couldn't stop thinking about while watching, Katherine Isabelle and Emily Perkins also played weird sisters in the 2008 rom-com _Another Cinderella Story_. They do an amazing job in that movie, and you can from that movie and this one that they have great chemistry playing sisters. Both of them also played minor characters in the CW's hit show _Supernatural_, but not in the same seasons.

I really loved the use of practical effects by the costume and set designers. Especially when it came to Ginger's transformation and making her gradual change into a wolf noticeable. The effects in this movie were very reminiscent of 80's horror films and it made me really happy to see!! The wolves that were built really enhanced the feel of the movie, making it seem like they were realistic, even if you knew they weren't. I think the movie also really brought home the *teenagedom* of it all, making you feel like you were in high school with Ginger and Bridgitte; especially as they were seen as the school outcasts. With this in mind, it felt like Ginger's transformation wasn't just about becoming a werewolf, more that it was about losing herself to popularity and it becoming her downfall. As well as finally being free or feeling free within her body, she became more confident in herself and used her body as a way to gain power and social status. The movie essentially made her freedom become deominzed by others, as society often does with women. I was super excited to finally see a werewolf movie (**yayy lyncanthropy**), sorry vampire movies you're cool and all, but there are other monsters too. The little details that wre put ito everything definitely brought the characters to life, you got a better sense of Ginger and Bridgitte because of the clothes they wore and their room. You got to see how different they were not only from the town, but also their parents with the contrasts in lighting and decoration. Their dynamic felt like a real sibling dynamic, although there were some parts where it was a bit questionable, but overall the movie was pretty rad. I also loved the fact that the Fitzgerald sisters were played by the iconic duo Katherine Isabelle and Emily Perkins, they really took the weird sister roles in the early 2000's and I thank them for that.

Fun Facts: To this day, Megan Fox continually refers to this movie as her favorite movie that she's done, she has so much love for it. The title of the movie comes from the song "Jennifer's Body" by the band _Hole_, and the script for the movie was written the same year as the script for Juno; which coincidentally had the same screenwriter. Here's a super fun fact in my opinion, Jennifer has a _Fall Out Boy_ poster above her bed in her room, and before Adam Brody got the role of Nickolai, Pete Wentz was actually considered for the role. 

This movie has recently become a cult classic and for great reason, it's jam-packed full of funny one liners like _"I am a god"_ and "I eat boys", which even if it wasn't explicitly said, the idea was there and it gets stuck in my head very fast. The soundtrack is absolutely amazing, which is expected for the time, since it was the height of the emo scene; it makes you feel like you're living in the early 2000's even if it's way past that. The not so obvious motif of reclamation, specifically after going through trauma that was inflicted due to sexual violence is so prominent within the movie and even though it may not have been the best representation that people needed, it definitely feels real. The intense need for revenge, going after those who wronged you and used you for their entertainment was strong within Jennifer's arc and later bled into Needy's. The narrative also let Jennifer take control of her own situation instead of making her out to be a helpless victim, like with so many horror girls. She was able to wield the power of her story in her hands and decided that the actions she believed would fit her best would be those of revenge. The outfits really felt like something high schooler's would wear, so they definitely deserve some points for that. In all, I think the costume departement did an amazing job, soem of the outfits, like Jennifer's heart ensemble became so popular that most people use that outfit for Halloween costumes. I really appreciated the scene where Jennifer tries to put makeup on after her "demonic" transformation; as if it was a symbol for peforming femininity, but also as a way of trying to get back her former self after a traumatizing event. It furthered the idea of letting her become the powerful character of her own story, she wasn't pushed aside or made out to be the "weak" one by those who weren't in the same situations as her. She decided that she wanted to be evil so that she could, in a sense, get revenge and honestly the story was very enjoyable.

Fun Facts: The opening scene involves a call to the police, and during filming Drew Barrymore accidnetally called the police. She didn't know the phone she was given wasn't a prop, so the mistake wasn't given any thought until after the set got a call back. Ghostface's voice is actually done by the voice actor Roger Jackson, who later gained a lot of popularity for playing Mojo Jojo in _The PowerPuff Girls_. The movie's color scheme that is used was largely based off of the famous painting "The Scream" by Edvard Munch.

It definitely has some iconic lines that are constantly quoted like _"Do you like scary movies?"_ and _"Please don't kill me Mr. Ghostface, I wanna be in the sequel." It's definitely one of those gateway slasher films, once you watch it you sort of want to start watching other slasher movies and maybe you'll navigate through different horror genres until you find one that you really like. In terms of *final girls* Sidney is one of the most popular ones that is known in the wider rings of society; it's been five movies and she's still surviving Ghostface. It's definitely a fun little slasher to watch, it also makes a mockery of slashers whilst being a slasher itself. The first film follows the original Ghostface killings and the story behind them, following a huge line of betrayal and death. There are many familiar faces if you're into popular '90s and early '00s media like Drew Barrymore (only the opening scene), Matthew Lillard, Courtney Cox, Rose McGowean, Skeet Ulrich, and Neve Campbell as Sidney herself. Scream has really become one of the more popular slasher series especially with younger audiences like teens and young adults since it wasn't made that long ago, and its popularity, from what I've seen so far, is very warranted. It's not too gorey, and it's full of suspense, it's a great movie to watch when you want to get into the spooky season.

Fun Facts: The show was originally based off the short story _Vampires Never Get Old: Tales with Fresh Bite_, written by V.E. Schwab, so the first couple episodes follow it pretty well. The pilot episode was also written by V.E. Schwab, after the rights for her short story were bought by Netflix. The show is set in Goergia, and most of the show was actually filmed in the location that the story inhabited; which is a huge difference compared to most television shows, which usually film in other states or Canada. Another other media fact is that Elizabeth Mitchell, who plays Margot Fairmont in the show, also played the ice queen in ABC's _Once Upon a Time_ in 2014.

I cannot recommend this show enough, it might be corny and campy, but oh my is it amazing. First of all, you have a black saphhic lead **and** she's a monster hunter. If that doesn't pull you in right away, then let me convinve you some more; it also has queer vampires and so much teenage angst. The show follows Calliope Burns and Juliette Fairmont throughout their love story as well as their respective families, since the Burns' are a hunting family and the Fairmonts are vampires, there's obviously some family tension that makes this show very reminescent of Romeo and Juliet. It's a tragic, *forbidden* love story and all of it is played so well by the actors. Unfortunately, the show aas cancelled by Netflix after its first seeason, and this was **not** due to lack of views. Despite it's cancellation, I really suggest giving the show a watch, a lot of time and effort was put into it and you should try and support the cast and crew that helped make this lovely show. **Plus**, the show's theme song is _thee_ scene song "The Zombie Song" by Stephanie Mabey, which was released in 2012 and it really paves the way for the campyness of the show.
