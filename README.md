# Hungry For Horrors
I watch widely popular horror movies, cult-classics even, and rate them on a skull-o-meter. Read all about the fun facts that came out of the making of these movies and some of my personal opinions on what makes these movies so awesome!!
# Work Those Ratings!!
Each of my ratings are going to be done based on how much I liked watching them, what I found cool about them, really anything that stood out to me. The ratings will be out of 10 skulls each, half points may be used, if they are they'll be represented by ghosts.
